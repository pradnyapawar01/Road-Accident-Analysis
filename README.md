## 🔬 Key Findings & Insights

### 🌅 Light Conditions & Visibility Impact

Road accidents show distinct patterns based on lighting:

- **Daylight accidents dominate**, suggesting high traffic volume correlation rather than visibility issues alone
- **Darkness with street lighting** shows unexpectedly high incident rates, indicating potential behavioral factors (speed, reduced vigilance)
- Minimal accidents under unknown conditions confirm robust data quality

**Recommendation**: Enhanced enforcement during lit nighttime hours may yield significant safety improvements.

---

### 🛣️ Road Infrastructure Analysis

Single carriageway roads emerge as the primary accident hotspot:

- **Single carriageways account for the majority** of incidents, reflecting their prevalence in the road network and mixed-use traffic patterns
- Dual carriageways show lower accident rates despite higher speeds, suggesting design effectiveness
- Roundabouts and slip roads demonstrate relatively safe performance

**Recommendation**: Infrastructure upgrades prioritizing single carriageway safety features (barriers, lighting, signage) could reduce accident frequency.

### 🏙️ Urban vs Rural Distribution

**Urban: 61%** | **Rural: 39%**

Urban areas dominate accident statistics, but context matters:

- Higher urban accident counts reflect population density and traffic volume
- Rural accidents, while fewer, often result in more severe outcomes due to higher speeds and delayed emergency response
- The 61/39 split suggests both environments require targeted interventions

**Recommendation**: Differentiated safety strategies—congestion management for urban areas, speed control and emergency response optimization for rural zones.

### 📅 Temporal Patterns & Seasonality

**Monthly Trends** reveal critical periods:

- **October and November** show peak accident activity, potentially linked to reduced daylight hours and weather transitions
- **May** also demonstrates elevated risk during favorable weather—possibly due to increased recreational travel
- **February** records the lowest incidents, correlating with reduced travel during winter

**Peak Time Analysis**: The 5:00 PM spike aligns with evening commute congestion and fatigue factors.

**Recommendation**: Seasonal safety campaigns before October and targeted enforcement during evening rush hours.

### 🌧️ Road Surface Conditions

Environmental factors significantly influence accident risk:

- **Dry surfaces** paradoxically show the highest accident frequency—volume effect rather than risk per mile
- **Wet/damp conditions** present elevated risk relative to exposure, confirming reduced traction hazards
- **Snow, ice, and flood** conditions show minimal incidents but often involve severe outcomes

**Critical Insight**: While dry road accidents dominate numerically, wet surface accidents may have higher severity rates.

**Recommendation**: Weather-adaptive speed limits and enhanced wet-weather driver education programs.
